=== To Do
  setup agent_helper to start multi-agents for all tests
  test: sync_codebase should clean working dir first
  fix: xtest_multi_dtr_tasks_should_be_queued_and_processed_one_by_one

  clean dtr/test_unit.rb
  use thread.join instead of counter to count test result size
  ???? agent brain should wakeup when worker is dead
  problem: when agent can't find test files, drb can't undump test object, the error would be: undefined method `run' for #<DRb::DRbUnknown:0x318800>
     * tell Master this error that agent can't know what's item sent from Master
  
  ?specify a working dir for agent
  master process is alive when using ctrl-c to cancel rake functional tests
  monitor dtr rinda server status
  monitor acceptance test
